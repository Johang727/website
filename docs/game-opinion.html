                                <p class="mb-3">Like the OP says, the player stays at Level 20 and there are no overworld segments, it's easy, back-to-back dungeon-ing. It's a full story-only hack which aren't the worst in my opinion: I do like myself a good story hack!</p>
                                
                                <p class="mb-3">The MC talks in this hack, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't an insertion story, <i>(the game asks for your name and a name to give your partner)</i>. This honestly is the only issue I have with this hack. The main reason that the MC in the base game doesn't speak often and somewhat generically, for lack of a better word, is because the MC needs to fit a wide range of people. When the MC says things that I, personally, wouldn't have said in that situation, it breaks the immersion a bit.</p>
                                
                                <p class="mb-3">Despite this, that doesn't mean the story or writing is bad, far from it. I feel like it captures the feeling of the original game. It flows nicely and doesn't drag on. I was not bored while I was playing, <i>(granted, it wasn't a long hack, but still)</i>.</p>
                                
                                <p class="mb-0"><b>Don't let my opinion discourage you! There's a reason I didn't go too into detail!</b> Honestly, I was tempted to replay the hack after seeing all the positive feedback on it, <i>(it has been a few months since I played through it).</i> I personally would replay with generic species names to get that 3rd person experience I feel this game needs, however, if you want to play it as an insertion story, go for it!</p>
