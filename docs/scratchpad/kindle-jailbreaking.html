                I had this Kindle Touch laying in a box unused for the past months or maybe even year, having moved on to using my tablet for reading, and ultimately not reading at all in recent times. I was thinking, there's gotta be a way to repurpose it, right? The new Kindles run Android.. which was simple, but I wasn't sure about this one.

            <p><i>Re-enactment</i></p>

            <p>
                So I did some research and luckily, these 2012 Kindles can be modded. It was the first time I was doing softmodding without a proper guide, being used to *.hacks.guide pages. So I turned to the dark side... <i>AI</i>...
            </p>
            <p>
                It started off well, providing me with common resources like <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=225030">MobileRead</a> forums.
            </p>
            <p>
                But the good times stopped there, it already gave me false information, telling me to create folders---essentially hallucinating a way to jailbreak, wasting me an hour or so trying to figure it out.. before I decided enough with AI for now and just do my own research.
            </p>

            <p>After finishing the jailbreak and ssh-ing into my Kindle, I needed to figure out how to make a cronjob for a dashboard. The normal command cronjob -e didn't work, erroring out. So I once again decided to ask AI... just another waste of time.</p>

            <p>It wanted me to <i>remove</i> the crontab directory to make my own crontab file in place of it, which I immediately knew was a bad idea and a potential brick waiting to happen. So I gave up on AI again and just used the paths it gave me to figure stuff out. I ended up finding out that cronjobs are just located under <b>/etc/crontab/root</b> and it was fairly simple to edit and add my own.</p>

            <p>After a bit of programming and tinkering, I ended up making a dashboard for my server which I feel like ended up quote nice. The Kindle only has about a two day battery now, but, it is better than sitting in a closet at 0% for its entire life.</p>

            <p><i>Kindle propped under my monitor for a quick view on my server in-case it's gonna blow.</i></p>

            <p>Honestly, I should give this kindle credit, it's surprisingly crisp and legible for being an 600x800 screen. There's plenty of space for server stats and even a small joke at the bottom :p</p>

            <hr>

            <p>TBH, there were many videos on how to jailbreak Kindles, but I personally just.. didn't wanna watch any since I really don't like watching videos like that, instead opting for text guides. So here's a text guide if you ever find yourself in a situation like mine!</p>


            <ol>
                <li>
                    Download the K5 Jailbreak files from <a href="https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/Touch/kindle-jailbreak-1.16.N-r19426.tar.xz">here.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unzip the contents of <b>kindle-5.4-jailbreak.zip</b> to the root of the device.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Open the <b>Menu</b> on your Kindle and go to <b>Settings</b>, open the <b>Menu</b> again and click <b>"Update Your Kindle"</b>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This should result in **** JAILBREAK **** displaying at the bottom.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Drag <b>Update_mkk-20250419-k5-ALL_keystore-install.bin</b> onto the root of your device and update your kindle using the same method as before.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Download KUAL from <a href="https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/KUAL/KUAL-v2.7.37-gfcb45b5-20250419.tar.xz">here.</a>
                </li>
                <li>Drag <b>KUAL-KDK-2.0.azw2</b> into the Kindle's Documents folder.</li>
                <li>Download MR Package Installer from <a href="https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/KUAL/kual-mrinstaller-1.7.N-r19303.tar.xz">here.</a></li>
                <li>Drag <b>extensions</b> and <b>mrpackages</b> into the root of your Kindle.</li>
                <li>Download USBNetwork from <a href="https://storage.gra.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_2ac4bfee353948ec8ea7fd1710574097/mr-public/Touch/kindle-usbnet-0.22.N-r19297.tar.xz">here.</a></li>
                <li>Copy <b>Update_usbnet_0.22.N_install_touch_pw.bin</b> to the <b>mrpackages</b> folder.</li>
                <li>Open KUAL &#62; Helper &#62; then tap "Install MR Packages"
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leave it be for a few minutes while it installs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Re-open KUAL and navigate to Toggle USBNetwork.</li>
                <li>From here, attempt to SSH into the Kindle. If the default passwords found <a href="https://www.sven.de/kindle/">here</a> don't work, then try:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connect your Kindle to your PC again through USB. You may need to untoggle USBNetwork for MTP to function.</li>
                        <li>In a terminal, run <b>ssh-keygen -t rsa</b>, you don't need to set a passphrase + store the key in its default location.</li>
                        <li>On your Kindle, create a file named <b>authorized_keys</b> in the <b>usbnet/etc</b> directory.</li>
                        <li>Copy the contents of <b>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</b> or <b>C:\Users\{username}\.ssh\id_rsa.pub</b> into authorized_keys</li>
                        <li>Attempt to SSH into your Kindle again and it should log in immediately with no password prompt.</li>
                        <li>Change the root password by running <b>mntroot rw</b> and <b>passwd root</b>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>You are now free to do whatever you want with your Kindle! I found the best way to keep the Kindle awake was to emulate a suspend loop using:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>lipc-set-prop com.lab126.powerd powerButton 1 && lipc-set-prop com.lab126.powerd powerButton 1</b></li>
                        <li>This resets the suspend timer more effectively than any other solution I have found. Just run it with a cronjob or within a script.</li>
                        <li><i>Also a quick note: you may edit cronjobs using <b>nano /etc/crontab/root</b></i></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                

            </ol>
