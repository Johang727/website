            <p>Drawing is fun, its a nice to see your art to completion. However, I struggle with getting past the sketching phase</p>

            <p>Regardless, I like flareons a bunch, so I decided to draw a few regardless. Only by the end of last year, only am I confident enough to say that my art is decent. I think I will look at these drawings in the future and probably think the same in the future.</p>

            <p>Sometime in October 2025, I finished this:</p>

            <p><img src="images/artwork/flareon_pfp_online.png" style="height: 300px;" alt="A portrait picture of a flareon's face at an angle."></p>
            
            <p>Tbh, I still <i>somewhat</i> like this one, but there are plenty of improvements. The tail is.. a bit wonky and I don't think it's long enough, but not very visible in a profile picture and well, that's the reason this exists.</p>

            <p>As you can see though, I could never get out of the sketchy phase.</p> 

            <hr>

            <p>I wanted to draw a full body next, therefore I decided to draw him on his back.</p>

            <p>This time, I actually have the in-between phases. As dumb as it sounds, I only just realized that starting with a really abstract sketch is a good way of getting started. One of the main reasons I don't really draw often was because I always skipped the "abstract" step and got unmotivated because I couldn't draw it xdd</p>

            <p><img src="images/artwork/abs_flareon_lay_back_online.jpeg" style="height: 400px;" alt="Abstract sketch of a flareon on his back."></p>

            <p>But yeah, starting with this phase... the rest of the drawing made a lot more sense. I did the rough sketch the same day, since a lot of features could get lost in abstraction.</p>

            <p><img src="images/artwork/rs_flareon_lay_back_online.jpeg" style="height: 400px;" alt="Rough sketch of a flareon on his back."></p>

            <p>Here you can see the vision a lot clearer, but it's quite rough around the edges. I took a break from it and came back a few days later, because I personally think it helps me find flaws and things I can improve easier.</p>

            <p><img src="images/artwork/cs_flareon_lay_back_safe_online.jpeg" style="height: 400px;"></p>

            <p>And here's a colored sketch. It still needs shading, but I just wanted to see how he would look colored. To be honest though... I feel like this is good enough to use as a picture for a reference sheet. I would need a standing image to complete it fully, but yeah, it's good as an alt.</p>

            <p>I've drawn other sketches where his paws were in frame, but they are quite old and really bad looking haha. I've always drawn 3 toes on each paw, but decided to be experimental and draw four this time. I personally think it looks better, even if the default flareon from the PKMN Company only has 3.</p>

            <p>I also decided to draw tufts of fluff on his cheeks since I thought they looked cute and made him look a bit fluffier.</p>

            <p>His left eye is purple and his right eye is orange. <i>Originally</i>, they were both orange, but after just randomly thinking about it, I said, meh, Heterochromia is pretty cool and went with it :p</p>

            <p>Anyways, flareon best Pokémon.</p>
