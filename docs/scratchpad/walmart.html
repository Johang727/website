            <i>Bored at Walmart? Run the TETR.IO benchmark!</i>

            <hr>

            <p>I remembered osk hosts the TETR.IO benchmark seperately on their website, and after remembering I crashed a Raspberry Pi when I went to Microcenter during WPL, I decided to see if any of these would crash!</p>

            <p>Sadly, none of them ended up crashing like the Raspberry Pi <i>(needing a full restart)</i>... but here's a list anyways sorted from highest score to lowest!</p>

            <p>I also included some of my own devices as well, because I was curious where they would fall!</p>

            <p><i>A quick aside: Chrome on the onn. kids tablet crashed shortly after running the test, it certainly was not the greatest.</i></p>
            <p>I do find it interesting that despite a few of these having the same CPU, performances were quite different, likely due to other components like RAM and storage type.</p>
            <p>What I did find interesting was how the i5 scored <i>worse</i> than the i3 for the same HP Laptop, could've just been an unlucky run or bad install however.</p>
            <p>Funnily enough, none of the chromebooks hit "C" / "Chromebook-Tier" as osk calls it, ironic.</p>
            <p>This is quite an old test, despite the last page update being on Sep 20, 2025! This benchmark should've definitely been updated after July 26, 2025, which is when BETA 1.0.0 released. Scoring 1M on this benchmark should not result in Ultra Graphics anymore. Quick Play 2 is just too bloated. Even at 2M, Ultra Graphics really isn't recommended, since you would likely get around 50 FPS, which in a game running at 60 FPS internally, 60 FPS is the ideal.</p>

            <p>However, if you hate constant stutters, Low Graphics is the best way to play, with animated backgrounds disabled and particles set to 0%. Heck, that still gives the occasional stutter. The only real way to play smoothly is to play using Minimal Graphics.</p>

            <p>TETR.IO is quite the unoptimized game.. isn't it?</p>
