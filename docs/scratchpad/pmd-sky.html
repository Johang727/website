                                    <small>Edited: Feb. 18, 2026 | Created: Jan. 31, 2026</small>
                                </div>
                                
                                <p>Starting off, the gameplay/story balance is very similar to the base game and I personally would say the difficulty is about the same, if not a smidge harder. This a third person story and not an insertion story, which I feel allows the character's backgrounds to be deeper.</p>

                            <p>Things I like and noticed from this hack:</p>
                            <p><small>(Blacked out parts are spoilers! Hover over them to view!)</small></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Overall great humor in general.</li>
                                <li>The title screen changes based on where you are in the story.</li>
                                <li>There's weather in Treasure Town! <i>(It doesn't really do much gameplay wise, but its really cool! Dialog is changed and there's water flowing into Spinda's Cafe during rain).</i></li>
                                <li>In-dungeon dialog <i>(by interacting with your teammates or pressing Talk in the menus)</i> has been changed to better reflect the characters' personalities.</li>
                                <li>Some exploration teams from the base game are expanded on and become side-main characters in this hack.</li>
                                <li>Seperate wonder bags for story events <i>(I didn't even know that would be possible!)</i></li>
                                <li>4, 5? Special Episodes that world build and help bring the story together. All of them are pretty good and none are hard.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><i>5 Special Episodes if you consider Outlaw's Paradise.</i></li>
                                    <li>For "The Perfect Mix", <span class="spoiler">you can end the alcoholism early which just displays END after Zigzagoon leaves, its hilarious.</span></li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Also, after Part 7, <span class="spoiler">I love how you can tell Team Redemption is getting more comfortable with each other through small interactions. It really does make me happy.</span></li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="spoiler">LIKE SHINX DOES THE POSE WITH RIOLU!! I hecking love it!!!</span></li>
                                </ul>
                            </ul>


                            <p>Overall, the story writing is hecking amazing and really keeps me wanting more! It really does capture the charm of the original game, while being its own great and unique story!</p>

                            <p>Fanart is reposted on their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lr-okami.bsky.social">bluesky profile</a>, so if you have played up to the point I have, then do check it out! Some of them are included in the zip file you download, but there are some new ones that are worth checking out! <b>Be warned, the fan art <i>will</i> spoil the game if you haven't completed it.</b></p>

                            <p>Please check this hack out if you don't mind somewhat darker themes! If I were to give this an age rating, I'd likely give it a <b>16+</b>, due to some of the more darker themes.</p>

                            <p>This hack is still a work in progress, with the last update being <b>Februrary 2026</b>, which is actually a bit of an issue now! The final part in the game has you <span class="spoiler">frozen in time, being in some sort of rendition of the dark future. You cannot earn experience here, therefore, if you <i>are</i> underleveled, its a bit of an issue! This is the only place in the game where you don't earn experience, apart from Shinx's nightmares in early game.</span></p>

                                <p>I decided to replay this hack, because I felt like my previous review was a bit harsh.</p>

                                <p>Starting off, I chose to name myself "Scorbunny", since I personally the story fits better this way. This review and its grade will be treated as a 3rd person story.</p>

                                <p>The humor is very similar to the original games, which I like. The story so far flows well and is engaging.</p>


                                <p>It's interesting how it takes place in the far, far future after PMD Sky, but like the new Pokémon who appear in place of the others.</p>


                                <p>Your level is locked at 20, which is plenty enough for the dungeons in this game. However, this level seems.. weird. If you are the savior of the future from the original game, why are you LV20, rather than high 30s, low 40s? Seems a bit inconsistent, but I digress.</p>

                                <p>You and Rockruff do missions behind a transition card, which is fine, its a short story and prevents filler for that. However, I wish your level increased by a few levels through that transition, just for story/gameplay consistency. Also, how as Rockruff's rash behavior not caused a problem throughout those, but just now when the user is playing?</p>

                                    <summary>Old Review (Dec. 1, 2025)</summary>
                                    <i>
                                        <p>Like the OP says, the player stays at Level 20 and there are no overworld segments, it's easy, back-to-back dungeon-ing with story in between. It's a full story-only hack which aren't the worst in my opinion: I do like myself a good story hack!</p>
                                    
                                        <p>The MC talks in this hack, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't an insertion story, <i>(the game asks for your name and a name to give your partner)</i>. This honestly is the only issue I have with this hack. The main reason that the MC in the base game doesn't speak often and somewhat generically, for lack of a better word, is because the MC needs to fit a wide range of people. When the MC says things that I, personally, wouldn't have said in that situation, it breaks the immersion a bit.</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Despite this, that doesn't mean the story or writing is bad, far from it. I feel like it captures the feeling of the original game. It flows nicely and doesn't drag on. I was not bored while I was playing, <i>(granted, it wasn't a long hack, but still)</i>.</p>
                                    
                                        <p><b>Don't let my opinion discourage you! There's a reason I didn't go too into detail!</b> Honestly, I was tempted to replay the hack after seeing all the positive feedback on it, <i>(it has been a few months since I played through it).</i> I personally would replay with generic species names to get that 3rd person experience I feel this game needs, however, if you want to play it as an insertion story, go for it!</p>
