                        <div class="col ms-3">
                            <p>Starting off, the gameplay/story balance is very similar to the base game and I personally would say the difficulty is about the same, if not a smidge harder. This a third person story and not an insertion story, which I feel allows the character's backgrounds to be deeper.</p>

                            <p>Things I like and noticed from this hack:</p>
                            <p><small>(Blacked out parts are spoilers! Hover over them to view!)</small></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Overall great humor in general.</li>
                                    <li>The title screen changes based on where you are in the story.</li>
                                    <li>There's weather in Treasure Town! <i>(It doesn't really do much gameplay wise, but its really cool! Dialog is changed and there's water flowing into Spinda's Cafe during rain).</i></li>
                                    <li>In-dungeon dialog <i>(by interacting with your teammates or pressing Talk in the menus)</i> has been changed to better reflect the characters' personalities.</li>
                                    <li>Some exploration teams from the base game are expanded on and become side-main characters in this hack.</li>
                                    <li>Seperate wonder bags for story events <i>(I didn't even know that would be possible!)</i></li>
                                    <li>4, 5? Special Episodes that world build and help bring the story together. All of them are pretty good and none are hard.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><i>5 Special Episodes if you consider Outlaw's Paradise.</i></li>
                                        <li>For "The Perfect Mix", <span class="spoiler">you can end the alcoholism early which just displays END after Zigzagoon leaves, its hilarious.</span></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Also, after Part 7, <span class="spoiler">I love how you can tell Team Redemption is getting more comfortable with each other through small interactions. It really does make me happy.</span></li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><span class="spoiler">LIKE SHINX DOES THE POSE WITH RIOLU!! I hecking love it!!!</span></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </ul>
                            
                            <p>Overall, the story writing is hecking amazing and really keeps me wanting more! It really does capture the charm of the original game, while being its own great and unique story!</p>

                            <p>Fanart is reposted on their <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lr-okami.bsky.social">bluesky profile</a>, so if you have played up to the point I have, then do check it out! Some of them are included in the zip file you download, but there are some new ones that are worth checking out! <b>Be warned, the fan art <i>will</i> spoil the game if you haven't completed it.</b></p>

                            <p>Please check this hack out if you don't mind somewhat darker themes! If I were to give this an age rating, I'd likely give it a <b>16+</b>, due to some of the more darker themes.</p>

                            <p><b>This hack is still a work in progress, with the last update being Februrary 2026.</b></p>

                        <div class="col ms-3">
                            <p>Like the OP says, the player stays at Level 20 and there are no overworld segments, it's easy, back-to-back dungeon-ing with story in between. It's a full story-only hack which aren't the worst in my opinion: I do like myself a good story hack!</p>
                            
                            <p>The MC talks in this hack, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't an insertion story, <i>(the game asks for your name and a name to give your partner)</i>. This honestly is the only issue I have with this hack. The main reason that the MC in the base game doesn't speak often and somewhat generically, for lack of a better word, is because the MC needs to fit a wide range of people. When the MC says things that I, personally, wouldn't have said in that situation, it breaks the immersion a bit.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite this, that doesn't mean the story or writing is bad, far from it. I feel like it captures the feeling of the original game. It flows nicely and doesn't drag on. I was not bored while I was playing, <i>(granted, it wasn't a long hack, but still)</i>.</p>
                            
                            <p><b>Don't let my opinion discourage you! There's a reason I didn't go too into detail!</b> Honestly, I was tempted to replay the hack after seeing all the positive feedback on it, <i>(it has been a few months since I played through it).</i> I personally would replay with generic species names to get that 3rd person experience I feel this game needs, however, if you want to play it as an insertion story, go for it!</p>
